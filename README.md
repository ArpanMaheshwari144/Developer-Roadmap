## LinkedIn Job Search Strategy

Maximize your job search effectiveness on LinkedIn with these strategies:

### 1. Search the right keywords
Look up terms like:
"HR", "Recruiter", "Talent Acquisition", "People", "Talent Scout", "HRBP" — these are the folks who can get your resume in front of the right people.

### 2. Use the "People" filter
Once you search, click on the "People" tab to narrow down results to individuals (not posts or jobs).

### 3. Filter by target company
Use the "Current Company" filter to only see employees from companies you want to work at.

### 4. Set "Connections" to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
This opens up your results — you don't need to know someone to connect!

### 5. Send personalized connection requests
Short, respectful messages expressing your interest in their company or role make a difference. Mention what you're applying for — keep it authentic.

### 6. Comment on posts from your target companies and recruiters
Get noticed by being visible. Thoughtful comments > cold DMs.

### 7. Use "Open to Work" — but customize it
Don't just turn it on — add job titles, locations, and employment types. LinkedIn promotes detailed profiles more.

### 8. Optimize your headline
Go beyond your job title. Try:
"SDE-1 | Java | ReactJs | Scalable systems | DSA | Open to new opportunities"

### 9. Use job alerts smartly
Apply within the first 24 hours (the earlier the better), recruiters are most active when listings go live.

### 10. Reach out to people who recently joined the company
New hires often know what worked in the interview process and are more likely to respond. They can provide the HR number also whom you can directly reach out.

### 11. Post content once/twice a week (even simple stuff!)
Talk about your journey, learning, or job search. It gets you visibility.

## Java Developer Learning Path

## Problem-Solving Philosophy

Remember that great software development is about:
- Understanding a problem
- Getting to know a domain
- Thinking about the solution
- Building the simplest solution that solves the problem
