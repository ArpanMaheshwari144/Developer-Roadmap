## LinkedIn Job Search Strategy

Optimize your job search on LinkedIn with these effective tactics:

### 1. Target the right people
Search for: "HR", "Recruiter", "Talent Acquisition", "People", "Talent Scout", "HRBP" - these professionals can connect your resume with hiring managers.

### 2. Use the "People" filter
After searching, click the "People" tab to focus on individuals rather than posts or job listings.

### 3. Filter by desired companies
Apply the "Current Company" filter to view only employees from your target organizations.

### 4. Expand your connection range
Set "Connections" to include 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree connections for broader networking opportunities.

### 5. Send customized connection requests
Craft brief, respectful messages mentioning your interest in their company and the position you're applying for - authenticity matters.

### 6. Engage with content
Comment thoughtfully on posts from target companies and recruiters to increase visibility - effective comments often outperform cold messages.

### 7. Optimize "Open to Work" settings
Don't just activate it - specify job titles, locations, and employment types as LinkedIn promotes detailed profiles.

### 8. Craft an effective headline
Go beyond your job title with something like:
"SDE-1 | Java | ReactJs | Scalable systems | DSA | Open to new opportunities"

### 9. Use job alerts strategically
Apply within 24 hours of posting (earlier is better) when recruiters are most active with new listings.

### 10. Connect with recent hires
New employees often understand what worked in the interview process and may be more responsive - they might also provide direct HR contact information.

### 11. Create regular content
Post once or twice weekly about your professional journey, learning experiences, or job search to increase visibility.
