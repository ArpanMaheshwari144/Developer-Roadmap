## LinkedIn Job Search Strategy

Optimize your job search on LinkedIn with these effective tactics:

### 1. Target the right people
Search for: "HR", "Recruiter", "Talent Acquisition", "People", "Talent Scout", "HRBP" - these professionals can connect your resume with hiring managers.

### 2. Use the "People" filter
After searching, click the "People" tab to focus on individuals rather than posts or job listings.

### 3. Filter by desired companies
Apply the "Current Company" filter to view only employees from your target organizations.

### 4. Expand your connection range
Set "Connections" to include 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree connections for broader networking opportunities.

### 5. Send customized connection requests
Craft brief, respectful messages mentioning your interest in their company and the position you're applying for - authenticity matters.

### 6. Engage with content
Comment thoughtfully on posts from target companies and recruiters to increase visibility - effective comments often outperform cold messages.

### 7. Optimize "Open to Work" settings
Don't just activate it - specify job titles, locations, and employment types as LinkedIn promotes detailed profiles.

### 8. Craft an effective headline
Go beyond your job title with something like:
"SDE-1 | Java | ReactJs | Scalable systems | DSA | Open to new opportunities"

### 9. Use job alerts strategically
Apply within 24 hours of posting (earlier is better) when recruiters are most active with new listings.

### 10. Connect with recent hires
New employees often understand what worked in the interview process and may be more responsive - they might also provide direct HR contact information.

### 11. Create regular content
Post once or twice weekly about your professional journey, learning experiences, or job search to increase visibility.

## Problem-Solving Philosophy

Remember that exceptional software development centers around:
- Thoroughly understanding the problem domain
- Deeply analyzing requirements
- Thoughtfully designing solutions
- Building the simplest implementation that effectively solves the problem

**Key Problem Categories:**

**String Processing:** Concatenated words, Longest substring without repeats, Interleaving string

**Search & Sort:** Min in rotated sorted array, 132 pattern, Largest divisible subset, Search a 2D matrix

**Hash-Based Solutions:** 4Sum, Rabbits in forest, Min window substring, Count nice pairs

**Stack & Queue Implementations:** IPO, Longest valid parentheses, Sliding window median, Sliding window max

**Greedy Approaches:** Maximize the topmost element after K moves

**Dynamic Programming:** Longest common subsequence, Longest consecutive sequence, Max strength of k disjoint subarrays

**Two-Pointer Techniques:** Boats to save people, 2Sum, Container with most water, Trapping rain water

**Graph & Tree Algorithms:** Cheapest flight within K stops, Satisfiability of equality equations, Unique paths, Collect coins in a tree
